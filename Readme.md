Follow any core updates and news on my Twitter acount [@RndMnkIII](https://twitter.com/RndMnkIII). this project is a hobby but it requires investing in arcade game boards and specific tools, so any donation is welcome: [https://ko-fi.com/rndmnkiii](https://ko-fi.com/rndmnkiii).

## About
This core as beta release will be published as independet core. Finally will be unified with the SNK Triple Z80 Core. For a list of games intended to work with the SNK Triple Z80 Core see:
[https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/snk.cpp](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/mame/drivers/snk.cpp). 


## Third party cores
* Daniel Wallner T80 core [jesus@opencores.org](https://opencores.org/projects/t80).
* JTOPL FPGA Clone of Yamaha OPL hardware by Jose Tejada, @topapate [(https://github.com/jotego/jtopl)](https://github.com/jotego/jtopl).
* Based on Tim Rudy 7400 TTL library [https://github.com/TimRudy/ice-chips-verilog](https://github.com/TimRudy/ice-chips-verilog).
## Instructions:
In a game of two players who play in alternating turns. 
You use a 8-way joystick control with two buttons: Bullets and Shells. To rotate the tank turret, the left and right triggers of a gamepad are used, simulating SNK's LS-30 rotary joystick.
You have additional buttons for Coin, Start, Pause and Service Mode. The controls of a second controller can be used for two players in alternate mode.

## Manual installation
Rename the Arcade-TNKIII_XXXXXXXX.rbf file to TNKIII_XXXXXXXX.rbf and copy to the SD Card to the folder  /media/fat/_Arcade/cores and the .MRA files to /media/fat/_Arcade.
